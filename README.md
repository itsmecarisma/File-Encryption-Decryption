This Java project revolves around implementing file encryption and decryption using the AES algorithm, a symmetric encryption technique. It begins by generating a secure AES key, saving it to a file for future use, and then employing this key to encrypt files. During encryption, the data is transformed into ciphertext, ensuring confidentiality. Conversely, decryption uses the same key to reverse the process, converting the ciphertext back to its original plaintext form. This project encapsulates key aspects of cryptography, such as key management, secure file handling, and the application of AES for data security.

The project's significance lies in demonstrating practical encryption techniques for safeguarding sensitive data. By encrypting and decrypting files, it illustrates fundamental principles of symmetric encryption and reinforces the importance of secure key storage and handling. Through hands-on implementation of AES encryption in Java, the project enhances understanding of cryptographic concepts and reinforces best practices for ensuring data confidentiality in software applications.
